The error message indicates that `self.agents` is being borrowed mutably and immutably at the same time in the `step_agents` function. This is not allowed in Rust because it can lead to data races and other undefined behavior. 

In this specific case, the issue is caused by the `&mut` reference used in the for loop. This creates an immutable reference to the hashmap keys and a mutable reference to the hashmap values, which is not allowed. To fix this, we can iterate over the mutable hashmap values directly like this:

```rust
fn step_agents(&mut self) {
    for agent in self.agents.values_mut() {
        self.do_stuff(agent);
    }
}
```

This will allow us to mutably borrow the agents in the hashmap without creating an immutable reference to the hashmap keys.
