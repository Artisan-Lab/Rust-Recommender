This error is occurring because the `vec1` vector is being moved during the for loop, as the loop is consuming the vector by taking ownership of its elements one at a time. This means that `vec1` is no longer available to be used after the loop. 

In this particular case, the code is trying to modify `vec1` by calling `vec1.push(7)` inside the loop, but since `vec1` has already been moved, this is not possible. 

To fix this, you could use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop, so that you can explicitly control the iteration and avoid the automatic consumption of the vector:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut vec1 = vec![4, 5];
    vec1.push(6);
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < vec1.len() {
        if vec1[i] % 2 == 0 {
            vec1.push(7);
        }
        i += 1;
    }
    vec1.push(8);
    println!("vec1={:?}", vec1);
}
```

Alternatively, you could clone the vector before the loop so that the original vector is still available for modification:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut vec1 = vec![4, 5];
    vec1.push(6);
    let vec2 = vec1.clone();
    for i in vec2 {
        if i % 2 == 0 {
            vec1.push(7);
        }
    }
    vec1.push(8);
    println!("vec1={:?}", vec1);
}
```
