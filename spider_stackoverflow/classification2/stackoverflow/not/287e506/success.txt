In this example, the variable `n` is borrowed by the reference `nref` in the statement `let nref = &n;`. After that, the code attempts to assign a new value to `n` with the statement `n = 3;`. However, `n` is still considered borrowed by the reference `nref`, and so the compiler throws an error saying that `n` cannot be assigned because it is borrowed. 

To fix this error, you can either remove the reference to `n` before attempting to assign a new value to it, or you can make the reference mutable by changing the declaration of `nref` to `let mut nref = &mut n;`. This will allow you to modify `n` while it is still being referenced by `nref`.
