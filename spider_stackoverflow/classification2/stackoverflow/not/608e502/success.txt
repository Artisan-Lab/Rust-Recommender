This code will not compile because it violates the rules of borrowing in Rust. You cannot have both a mutable and immutable borrow of the same data at the same time.

In this case, the code first borrows `s` immutably and binds it to `r`. Then, it tries to borrow `s` mutably and bind it to `x`. This is not allowed because `r` is still holding an immutable borrow of `s`. As a result, the compiler reports an error with the message:

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
```

To fix this error, you need to make sure that you only have one borrow of `s` at any given time. If you need to mutate `s`, you should avoid creating an immutable borrow of it. Conversely, if you need to read from `s`, you should avoid creating a mutable borrow of it.
