The error message is telling us that we cannot borrow `self.a` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable. The problem is in the `do_stuff` method where we are calling `self.a.do_something(self.get_b())`. 

The `get_b` method returns a reference to `self.b`, which means that `self.a` is borrowed as immutable. When we call `self.a.do_something`, we are trying to borrow `self.a` as mutable at the same time, which is not allowed. 

To fix this error, we need to make sure that we don't borrow `self.a` as immutable and mutable at the same time. One way to do this is to change the `do_something` method to take a reference to `B` instead of `&self`, like this:

```rust
pub fn do_something(&mut self, other: &B) {
    self.a.value += other.value;
}
```

Then, we can call this method with `self.b` instead of `self.get_b()`:

```rust
self.a.do_something(&self.b);
```

With these changes, the `do_stuff` method should look like this:

```rust
pub fn do_stuff(&mut self) -> i64 {
    self.a.do_something(&self.b);
    self.a.value()
}
``` 

Now the code should compile without any errors.
