One way to fix this error is to avoid having a reference to `Thing`'s `value` in the `increment_if_odd` function. Here's one possible implementation:

```
struct Thing {
    value: i32
}

impl Thing {
    fn increment_if_odd(&mut self) -> &i32 {
        if self.value % 2 == 0 {
            return &self.value;
        }
        self.value += 1;
        &self.value
    }
}
```

This implementation removes the need for the `increment_if_odd` function to borrow `Thing`'s `value` field separately, by making `increment_if_odd` a method of `Thing` itself. This way, the mutable borrow of `Thing` is exclusive, and there's no need for a separate immutable borrow of `value`.
