The error message indicates that the function `to_bytes()` is returning a reference to the local variable `bytes`, which is deallocated when the function returns. This means that the returned reference is invalid and can lead to undefined behavior if it is used.

To fix this error, you can allocate the buffer on the heap using a `Vec<u8>` instead of an array on the stack. Here is an updated version of the code:

```rust
struct SomeData(u8, u8);

impl SomeData {
    fn to_bytes(&self) -> Vec<u8> {
        let mut bytes = Vec::with_capacity(16);

        // fill up buffer with some data in `SomeData`.
        bytes.push(self.0);
        bytes.push(self.1);

        // return vector
        bytes
    }
}
```

In this version, `bytes` is allocated on the heap using `Vec::with_capacity(16)`. The data is pushed into the vector using the `push()` method, which adds elements to the end of the vector. Finally, the vector is returned, which transfers ownership of the allocated memory to the caller.
