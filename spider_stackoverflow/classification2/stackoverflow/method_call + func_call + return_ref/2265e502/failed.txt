The error occurs because `s` is borrowed as immutable by the call to `first_word(&s)`, and at the same time, it is also borrowed as mutable by the call to `s.clear()`. 

The function `first_word` returns a string slice that points to a position in the original string `s`, and this string slice has an immutable borrow on `s` that lasts as long as the string slice exists. Since `word` is assigned to the result of `first_word(&s)`, it holds a string slice that borrows `s`. Thus, when the call to `s.clear()` tries to borrow `s` mutably, Rust compiler detects the mutable borrow as invalid since there is an outstanding immutable borrow. 

Therefore, to fix the error, we have to make sure that there are no outstanding immutable borrows when `s.clear()` is called. One way to do this is by changing the function `first_word` to return a string slice that doesn't borrow `s`. We can simply return a string literal instead of returning a string slice pointing to the input string. This way, `word` will not hold a borrow on `s`, and we can call `s.clear()` safely.

Here's the modified version of `first_word` that returns a string literal:

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    "there"
}
```

With this modification, the program will compile and run without errors, but the function `first_word` always returns the same string `"there"`, regardless of the input string.
