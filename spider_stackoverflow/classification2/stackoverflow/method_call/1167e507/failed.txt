The error message indicates that the method `get_a_new_foo()` moves `self`, which conflicts with the fact that `self` is borrowed as mutable in `replace_foo()`. To resolve this issue, we can change the signature of `get_a_new_foo()` to take ownership of `self` by replacing `self` with `mut self`. Here's the corrected code:

```
enum Foo {
    A,
    B(Vec<u32>),
}

impl Foo {
    fn get_a_new_foo(mut self) -> Foo {
        match self {
            Foo::A => Foo::B(vec![]),
            Foo::B(mut v) => {
                let len = v.len() as u32;
                v.push(len - 1);
                Foo::B(v)
            }
        }
    }
}

struct Bar(Foo);
impl Bar {
    fn replace_foo(&mut self) -> () {
        self.0 = self.0.get_a_new_foo();
    }
}

fn main() {}
```
