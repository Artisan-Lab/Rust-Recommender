The error message is telling us that we're trying to borrow `b` as mutable more than once at a time. In this case, we're trying to pass the result of `b.bar()` as an argument to `b.foo()`, which means that we're trying to borrow `b` mutably for the first time to call `b.bar()`, and then borrow it mutably again to call `b.foo()`. Since we can't have two mutable borrows of the same value at the same time, the compiler gives us an error.

One way to fix this error is to split the code into two separate statements, like this:

```
let mut b = A{};
let i = b.bar();
b.foo(i);
```

This way, we borrow `b` mutably only once per statement, and the code compiles without errors.
