The compilation error occurs because `&self` is an immutable reference to `MainStruct`, but `self.helper` is a mutable reference to `HelperStruct`. You cannot have both an immutable and a mutable reference to the same value at the same time.

To fix this error, you can change `&self` to `&mut self` in `call_helper()` to make `self` a mutable reference to `MainStruct`. This way, you can pass `&mut self` to `the_method()` and call `self.helper.the_method(self)` instead of `self.helper.the_method(&self)`. Here's the corrected code:

```
struct HelperStruct {
    
}

struct MainStruct {
    helper: HelperStruct,
}

impl MainStruct {
    pub fn call_helper(&mut self) { 
        // &mut self because the_method changes inner state of HelperStruct
        self.helper.the_method(self);
    }
}

impl HelperStruct {
    pub fn the_method(&mut self, owner: &mut MainStruct) {
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    
}
```
