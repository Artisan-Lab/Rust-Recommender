This error occurs because the code is trying to move the value out of an `Option` enum variant while borrowing the option's value mutably.

To fix the error, the code needs to replace the `let Some(se)` pattern match with a `let Some(&mut se)` pattern match, so that it borrows the value rather than moving it. Here's an updated version of the code with the fix:

```
enum SomeEnum {
    Foo,
    Bar,
}

struct SomeStruct {
    attrib: SomeEnum,
    next_attrib: Option<SomeEnum>,
}

impl SomeStruct {
    pub fn apply_changes(&mut self) {
        if let Some(&mut se) = self.next_attrib.as_mut() {
            self.attrib = se;
        }
        self.next_attrib = None;
    }
}
```

Note that the `se` variable is now a mutable reference (`&mut se`) rather than a value (`se`). Also, the `as_mut()` method is used to borrow the value mutably from the `Option` enum variant. Finally, the `Copy` trait is not required for the `SomeEnum` type in this case.
