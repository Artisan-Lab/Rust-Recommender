The error is indicating that `data` is moved when passed to `io::Cursor::new(data)` and thus it cannot be used after the function call. 

To fix the issue, you can change the signature of `take_reference` to take ownership of the `Vec<u8>` and return it back to `produce_data` after the function call. Here's an updated code:

```
use std::io;

fn use_cursor(cursor: &mut io::Cursor<&mut Vec<u8>>) {
    // do some work
}

fn take_reference(mut data: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    {
        let mut buf = io::Cursor::new(&mut data);

        use_cursor(&mut buf);
    }

    data
}

fn produce_data() {
    let mut data = Vec::new();
    data = take_reference(data);
    data.len();
}
```

Now `take_reference` takes ownership of `data`, creates a `Cursor` from a mutable reference to it, does some work on it, and returns the ownership of the modified vector to `produce_data`. This way, there is no move of `data` and it can be used after the function call.
