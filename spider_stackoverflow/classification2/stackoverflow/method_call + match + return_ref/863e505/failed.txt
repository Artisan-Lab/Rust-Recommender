This error occurs because you're trying to move out of `box_node` while it is still borrowed.

In the `find_mut` function, `node` is a mutable reference to the root of the binary tree. In the loop, you are using pattern matching to match the `node` to `Some(box_node)` and checking if the `key` is equal to `box_node.key`. If the `key` is not equal, then you are moving the mutable reference to `box_node.left` or `box_node.right`.

However, when you match to `other`, which is the case where `box_node.key` is equal to `key`, you're trying to return `other`, which is the `Option<Box<Node>>` that `node` is currently pointing to. Since `node` is still borrowed, you can't move out of `box_node`.

To fix this, you can change the return type of `find_mut` to `Option<&mut Node>`, which allows you to return a mutable reference to the `Node` itself instead of the `Option<Box<Node>>`. This way, you can avoid the issue of moving out of the borrowed `box_node`.

Here's an updated version of the code:

```
struct Node {
    key: i32,
    value: i32,
    left: Option<Box<Node>>,
    right: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct BinaryTree {
     root: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

impl BinaryTree {
    fn find_mut(&mut self, key: i32) -> Option<&mut Node> {
        let mut node = &mut self.root;
        loop {
            match node {
                Some(box_node) if box_node.key != key => {
                    node = if box_node.key < key {
                        &mut box_node.right
                    } else {
                        &mut box_node.left
                    }
                },
                Some(box_node) => return Some(&mut **box_node),
                None => return None,
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {}
```

In the updated code, `find_mut` returns an `Option<&mut Node>` instead of `&mut Option<Box<Node>>`. The `loop` continues until it finds a matching key or reaches the end of the tree. If it finds a matching key, it returns a mutable reference to the `Node` by dereferencing the `Box` twice (`**box_node`). If it reaches the end of the tree, it returns `None`.
