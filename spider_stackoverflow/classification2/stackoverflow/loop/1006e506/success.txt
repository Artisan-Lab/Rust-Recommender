The error message indicates that `u[i]` cannot be assigned to because it is currently borrowed. This is because `e` is a reference to `u[i]` that is pushed into the `v` vector. Since `v` might outlive the loop and `u`, it is not safe to hold a reference to `u` beyond its lifetime. To fix this, one solution is to change the type of `v` to hold owned values instead of references. Here is an example of how you can modify the code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut u: [usize; 3] = [0; 3];
    let mut v = vec![];
    for i in 0..3 {
        u[i] = i;
        let e = u[i];
        v.push(e);
    }
    println!("{:?}", v);
}
```

In this modified code, `v` is a `Vec<usize>` instead of a `Vec<&usize>`, and the `push()` method is called with an owned value `e` instead of a reference to `u[i]`. The program now prints `[0, 1, 2]` as expected.
