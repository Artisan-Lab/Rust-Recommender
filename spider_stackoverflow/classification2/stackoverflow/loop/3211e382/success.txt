The error is due to the fact that the variable `a` was moved into the first `for` loop, and then it cannot be used again in the second `for` loop. One way to solve the issue is to use a reference to `a` in the second loop, like this:

```
fn main() {
    let a = vec![1, 2, 3];
    for i in &a {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
    for j in &a {
        println!("{}", j);
    }
}
```

Here, `&a` creates an immutable reference to `a`, which can be used multiple times.
