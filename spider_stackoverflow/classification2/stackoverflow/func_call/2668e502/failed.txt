This code gives a compilation error because `a` is already borrowed as mutable when trying to call `f1(&a)`, which requires an immutable borrow. This is not allowed in Rust as it would violate the borrowing rules.

To fix the error, you can create a new variable to hold an immutable reference to `a` before the mutable reference is created. Here's an updated version of the code that compiles successfully:

```rust
fn f1(a: &u32) {
    print!("{:?}", a);
}

fn main() {
    let mut a = 3;
    let a_ref = &a;
    let b = &mut a;
    f1(&a_ref);
    *b += 1;
    print!("{:?}", b);
}
```

In this version, we create a new variable `a_ref` that holds an immutable reference to `a`, and pass that to `f1` instead of `&a`. This way, we can still use `a` mutably later in the code.
