This code will not compile because `foo` is already being mutably borrowed when `f` is called with a shared reference to `foo`. This is not allowed since mutable references are exclusive; they prevent any other kind of borrowing until the mutable reference goes out of scope.

To fix this, you need to make sure that `foo` is not being mutably borrowed when `f` is called. One way to do this is to create a new variable that is a shared reference to `foo.b`, like so:

```
fn main() {
    let mut foo = A { b: B { c: 2 } };
    let bar = &mut foo.b;
    let b_ref = &foo.b;
    f(&foo);
    g(bar);
}
```

Now, `f` is called with a shared reference to `foo.b` instead of a shared reference to the whole `foo` struct. This means that `foo` is no longer being mutably borrowed at the same time as the shared reference, and the code will compile without errors.
